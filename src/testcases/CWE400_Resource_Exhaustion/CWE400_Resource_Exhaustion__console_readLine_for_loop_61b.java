 * CWE: 400 Resource Exhaustion
 * BadSource: console_readLine Read count from the console using readLine
 * GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
 * Sinks: for_loop
 *    GoodSink: Validate count before using it as the loop variant in a for loop
 *    BadSink : Use count as the loop variant in a for loop
 * Flow Variant: 61 Data flow: data returned from one method to another in different classes in the same package
