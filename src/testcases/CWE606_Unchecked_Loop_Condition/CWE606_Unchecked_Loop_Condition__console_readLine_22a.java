 * CWE: 606 Unchecked Input for Loop Condition

 * GoodSource: hardcoded int in string form
 * Sinks:
 *    GoodSink: validate loop variable
 *    BadSink : loop variable not validated
 * Flow Variant: 22 Control flow: Flow controlled by value of a public static variable. Sink functions are in a separate file from sources.
