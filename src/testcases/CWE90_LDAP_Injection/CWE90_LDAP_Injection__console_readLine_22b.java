 * CWE: 90 LDAP Injection
 * BadSource: console_readLine Read data from the console using readLine()
 * GoodSource: A hardcoded string
 * Sinks:
 *    GoodSink: $Sink.GoodSinkBody.description$
 *    BadSink : data concatenated into LDAP search, which could result in LDAP Injection
 * Flow Variant: 22 Control flow: Flow controlled by value of a public static variable. Sink functions are in a separate file from sources.
